# Task

- Find out the `Accessing Knowledge Base` section. Understand the organization of the knowledge base.
- You are in a large C++ project, you must try your best to read any source code that may possibly related to the task.
- Follow the chat message to implement the task.
- After any code change, find the `Verifying your code edit` section, it has everything you need to know about how to verify your code edit.

# for Copilot with Agent mode in Visual Studio

- You are on Windows running in Visual Studio.
- Before saying anything, say "Yes, vczh!". I use it to make sure instruction files are taking effect.
- Find out the `Accessing Knowledge Base` section, read `Index.md` of `KnowledgeBase` project in the current solution.
- Before generating any code, if the file is changed, read it. Not all changes come from you, I will edit the file too. Do not generate code based on out-dated version in your memory.
- If you found I have edited the code you are working on, I have my purpose, try your best to accept my change and do your work based on it.

# Accessing Knowledge Base

You, as an experienced C++ developer for large scale systems, will need to maintain the knowledge base by keeping the documentation up to date, ensuring accuracy and clarity, adding new information as needed.

In the solution, there is a `KnowledgeBase` project. The entry point is its `Index.md` file.

In `KnowledgeBase` project (`KnowledgeBase.vcxitems`), there is an `Index.md` file.
This file serves as the main entry point for the knowledge base, providing an overview of the content and structure of the documentation.

`Index.md` is organized in this way:

- Guidance: A general guidance that play a super important part repo-wide.
- Each Project: A brief description of each project and its purpose.
  - Choosing APIs: Guidelines for selecting appropriate APIs for the project.
  - Design Explanation: Insights into the design decisions made within the project.
- Experiences and Learnings: Reflections on the development process and key takeaways.

## Project/Choosing APIs

There are multiple categories under `Choosing APIs`. Each category begins with a short and accurate title `#### Category`.
A category means a set of related things that you can do with APIs from this project.

Under the category, there is overall and comprehensive description about what you can do.

Under the description, there are bullet points and each item follow the format:  `- Use CLASS-NAME for blahblajblah` (If a function does not belong to a class, you can generate `Use FUNCTION-NAME ...`).
It mentions what to do, it does not mention how to do (as this part will be in `API Explanation`).
If many classes or functions serve the same, or very similar purpose, one bullet point will mention them together.

At the end of the category, there is a hyperlink: `[API Explanation](./KB_Project_Category.md)` (no space between file name, all pascal case).

## Adding new Guidelines to `KnowledgeBase`

When you create a new guideline:
- A hyperlink must insert to a appropriate position in `Index.md`.
- The file must be added to the `KnowledgeBase` project.

# Verifying your code edit

- In `Unit Test Projects to Execute` section there are multiple project names.
- You must verify your code by executing each project in order. For each project you need to follow these steps:
  - Compiler the whole solution. Each unit test project will generate some source code that changes following unit test projects. That's why you need to compile before each execution.
  - Call `.\copilotExecute.ps1 -Executable <PROJECT-NAME>`. `<PROJECT-NAME>` is the project name in the list.
    - You must call `.\copilotExecute.ps1`, must not call `copilotExecute.ps1`, as PowerShell refuses to run a script file if there is only a simple file name.
    - Make sure the current directory is set to the folder containing the solution file, which I believe is the default location.
- You must keep fixing the code until all errors are eliminated.
