# Execution

## Goal and Constraints

- You are going to apply changes on the source code as well following `Copilot_Execution.md`.

## Step 1. Identify the Problem

- The execution document is in `Copilot_Execution.md`
- Find `# Update` in the LATEST chat message. Ignore any `# Update` in the chat history.
- If there is an `# Update` section: it means I am going to propose some change to `Copilot_Execution.md` and the source code together.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Update` from the LATEST chat message to the `# UPDATES` section, with a new sub-section `## UPDATE`.
  - Follow my update to change the execution document and the source code.
- If there is nothing:
  - Apply all code changes in `Copilot_Execution.md` to the source code.
  - After applying each step in `Copilot_Execution.md`, mark the step as completed by appending `[DONE]` after the step title. This allow you to find where you are if you are interrupted.

## Step 2. Make Sure the Code Compiles but DO NOT Run Unit Test

- Check out `Compile the Solution` for details about compiling the solution but DO NOT run unit test. If there is any compilation warning or error, address all of them:
  - If there is any compile warning, only fix warnings that caused by your code change. Do no fix any other warnings.
  - If there is any compile error, you need to carefully identify, is the issue in the callee side or the caller side. Check out similar code before making a decision.
  - For every attempt of fixing the source code:
    - Explain why the original change did not work.
    - Explain what you need to do.
    - Explain why you think it would solve the build break.
    - Log these in `Copilot_Execution.md`, with section `## Fixing attempt No.<attempt_number>` in `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.
  - Redo `Step 2. Make Sure the Code Compiles but DO NOT Run Unit Test`.
- When the code compiles:
  - DO NOT run any tests, the code will be verified in future tasks.

# External Tools Environment and Context

- You are on Windows running in Visual Studio Code.
- In order to achieve the goal, you always need to create/delete/update files, build the project, run the unit test, etc. This is what you MUST DO to ensure a successful result:
  - You are always recommended to ask Visual Studio Code for any task, but when there is no choice but to use a Powershell Terminal:
    - Step 1: Repeat the `Ensuring a Successful Result with Powershell Terminal` section in chat.
    - Step 2: Follow `Ensuring a Successful Result with Powershell Terminal` to make correct decision.

## Ensuring a Successful Result with Powershell Terminal

- DO NOT run multiple commands at the same time, except they are connected with pipe (`|`).
- DO NOT call `msbuild` or other executable files by yourself.
- DO NOT create any new file unless explicitly directed.
- MUST run any powershell script in this format: `& absolute-path.ps1 parameters...`.
- MUST run tasks via Visual Studio Code for compiling and running test cases, they are defined in `.vscode/tasks.json`, DO NOT change this file.
- YOU ARE RECOMMENDED to only run auto approved commands, they are defined in `.vscode/settings.json`, DO NOT change this file.

# General Instructions

- Find out the `Accessing the Knowledge Base` section, read `Index.md` of `KnowledgeBase` project in the current solution.
- Before generating any code, if the file is changed, read it. Not all changes come from you, I will edit the file too. Do not generate code based on out-dated version in your memory.
- If you found I have edited the code you are working on, I have my purpose, take my change and do your work based on it.
- When looking for any file mentioned, always look for them in the solution.
  - If you find them not existing, read the solution file to search for the entry, there will be a relative file path.
- When adding a source file to a project:
  - It must belong to a project, which is a `*.vcxproj` or `*.vcxitems` file.
  - It is an XML file.
  - Edit that project file to include the source file.
- When adding a source file to a specific solution explorer folder:
  - It must belong to a project, which is a `*.vcxproj` or `*.vcxitems` file.
  - Find the `*.filters` file with the same name, it is an XML file.
  - Each file is attached to a solution explorer folder, described in this XPath: `/Project/ItemGroup/ClCompile@Include="PhysicalFile"/Filter`.
  - In side the `Filter` tag there is the solution explorer folder.
  - Edit that `*.filters` file to include the source file.

# Accessing Log Files and PowerShell Scripts

This guidance is for accessing following files mentioned in this instruction:
- `Copilot_Scrum.md`
- `Copilot_Task.md`
- `Copilot_Planning.md`
- `Copilot_Execution.md`
- `Copilot_KB.md`
- `copilotPrepare.ps1`
- `copilotBuild.ps1`
- `copilotExecute.ps1`

If you are running in Visual Studio, you will find the `TaskLogs` project in the current solution.
Otherwise, locate the `TaskLogs` project in `REPO-ROOT/.github/TaskLogs/TaskLogs.vcxitems`.
`REPO-ROOT` is the root folder of the repo.

`TaskLogs.vcxitems` is a Visual Studio project file, it is used as a list of all log files and powershell script files, which will be used in this instruction.
You need to locate listed files in `TaskLogs.vcxitems`.

## Important Rules for Markdown Document or Log

- Do not print "````````" or "````````markdown" in markdown file.
- It is totally fine to have multiple top level `# Topic`.
- When mentioning a C++ name in markdown file:
  - If it is defined in the standard C++ library or third-party library, use the full name.
  - If it is defined in the source code, use the full name if there is ambiguity, and then mention the file containing its definition.

# Unit Test Projects to Work with

## Compile the Solution

- Just let Visual Studio Code to compile the solution, the `Build Unit Tests` should have been configured in `tasks.json`.
  - This task only copmile without running.
- If Visual Studio Code is not well configured, you must warn me in chat with BIG BOLD TEXT and stop immediately.
- DO NOT use msbuild by yourself.
- DO NOT modify `tasks.json`.

## Executing Unit Test

- Just let Visual Studio Code to run the unit test, the `Run Unit Tests` should have been configured in `tasks.json`.
  - If you updated any source files, you should build the unit test before running it, check out `Compile the Solution` for details.
  - Run the `Run Unit Tests` task.
  - When all test cases pass, there will be a summarizing about how many test cases are executed. Otherwise it crashed at the last showing test case.
- If Visual Studio Code is not well configured, you must warn me in chat with BIG BOLD TEXT and stop immediately.
- DO NOT call executables or scripts yourself.
- DO NOT modify `tasks.json`.
