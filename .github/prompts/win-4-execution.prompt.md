# Execution

## Goal and Constraints

- You are going to apply changes on the source code as well following `Copilot_Execution.md`.

## Copilot_Execution.md Structure

- `# !!!EXECUTION!!!`: This file always begin with this title.
- `# UPDATES`:
  - `## UPDATE`: There could be multiple occurrences. Each one has an exact copy of the update description I gave you.
- `# IMPROVEMENT PLAN`.
- `# TEST PLAN`.
- `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.

## Step 1. Identify the Problem

- The execution document is in `Copilot_Execution.md`
- Find `# Update` in the LATEST chat message. Ignore any `# Update` in the chat history.
- If there is an `# Update` section: it means I am going to propose some change to `Copilot_Execution.md` and the source code together.
  - Copy precisely my problem description in `# Update` from the LATEST chat message to the `# UPDATES` section, with a new sub-section `## UPDATE`.
  - Follow my update to change the execution document and the source code.
- If there is nothing:
  - Apply all code changes in `Copilot_Execution.md` to the source code.
    - Make sure indentation and line breaks are applied correctly, following the same style in the target file.
  - After applying each step in `Copilot_Execution.md`, mark the step as completed by appending `[DONE]` after the step title. This allow you to find where you are if you are interrupted.

## Step 2. Make Sure the Code Compiles but DO NOT Run Unit Test

- Check out `Compile the Solution` for details about compiling the solution but DO NOT run unit test.
  - `Compile the Solution` is the only way to build the project. DO NOT call any other tools or scripts.
  - Each attempt of build-fix process should be executed in a sub agent.
    - One build-fix process includes one attempt following `Build Unit Test` and `Fix Compile Errors`.
    - The main agent should call different sub agent for each build-fix process.
    - Do not build and retrieve build results in the main agent.

### Use a sub agent to run the following instructions (`Build Unit Test` and `Fix Compile Errors`)

#### Build Unit Test

- Find out if there is any warning or error.
  - `Compile the Solution` has the instruction about how to check compile result.

#### Fix Compile Errors

- If there is any compilation error, address all of them:
  - If there is any compile warning, only fix warnings that caused by your code change. Do no fix any other warnings.
  - If there is any compile error, you need to carefully identify, is the issue in the callee side or the caller side. Check out similar code before making a decision.
  - For every attempt of fixing the source code:
    - Explain why the original change did not work.
    - Explain what you need to do.
    - Explain why you think it would solve the build break.
    - Log these in `Copilot_Execution.md`, with section `## Fixing attempt No.<attempt_number>` in `# FIXING ATTEMPTS`.
- After finishing fixing, exit the current sub agent and tell the main agent to go back to `Step 2. Make Sure the Code Compiles but DO NOT Run Unit Test`.
- When the code compiles:
  - DO NOT run any tests, the code will be verified in future tasks.

# Step 3. Verify Coding Style

- Code changes in `Copilot_Execution.md` may not consider about indentation and coding style.
  - Go over each code change and ensure:
    - Indentation is correct and consistent with the surrounding code.
    - Coding style especially line breaks follows the same conventions as the surrounding code.
- Ensure any empty line does not contain spaces or tabs.

# External Tools Environment and Context

- You are on Windows running in Visual Studio Code.
- Submitting CLI commands is not recommended unless you have no choice.
- There is some rules to follow to submit correct powershell commands:
  - DO NOT call `msbuild` or other executable files by yourself.
  - DO NOT create or delete any file unless explicitly directed.
  - MUST run any powershell script in this format: `& absolute-path.ps1 parameters...`.
  - MUST run tasks via Cursor for compiling and running test cases.

# Accessing Log Files and PowerShell Scripts

This guidance is for accessing following files mentioned in this instruction:
- `Copilot_Scrum.md`
- `Copilot_Task.md`
- `Copilot_Planning.md`
- `Copilot_Execution.md`
- `Copilot_KB.md`
- `copilotPrepare.ps1`
- `copilotBuild.ps1`
- `copilotExecute.ps1`
- `Build.log`
- `Execute.log`

They are in the `REPO-ROOT/.github/TaskLogs` folder.

`REPO-ROOT` is the root folder of the repo.

## If you are running in Visual Studio

You will find the `TaskLogs` project in the current solution, which should contain these files.

## Important Rules for Markdown Document or Log

- Do not print "````````" or "````````markdown" in markdown file.
- It is totally fine to have multiple top level `# Topic`.
- When mentioning a C++ name in markdown file:
  - If it is defined in the standard C++ library or third-party library, use the full name.
  - If it is defined in the source code, use the full name if there is ambiguity, and then mention the file containing its definition.

# Unit Test Projects to Work with

## Compile the Solution

- Run the `Build Unit Tests` task.
- DO NOT use msbuild by yourself.

### The Correct Way to Read Compiler Result

- The only source of trust is the raw output of the compiler.
  - It is saved to `REPO-ROOT/.github/TaskLogs/Build.log`. `REPO-ROOT` is the root folder of the repo.
  - Wait for the task to finish before reading the log file. DO NOT HURRY.
- DO NOT TRUST related tools Visual Studio Code offers you, like `get_errors` or `get_task_output`, etc.

## Executing Unit Test

- Run the `Run Unit Tests` task.
- DO NOT call executables or scripts yourself.

### The Correct Way to Read Test Result

- The only source of trust is the raw output of the unit test process.
  - It is saved to `REPO-ROOT/.github/TaskLogs/Execute.log`. `REPO-ROOT` is the root folder of the repo.
  - Wait for the task to finish before reading the log file. DO NOT HURRY.
  - When all test cases pass, there will be a summarizing about how many test cases are executed. Otherwise it crashed at the last showing test case.
- DO NOT TRUST related tools Visual Studio Code offers you, like `get_errors` or `get_task_output`, etc.
