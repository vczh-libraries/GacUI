# Properties and Events (class)

Properties and events are allowed in classes.

## Defining properties and events

When property **Name** is associated with event **NameChanged**, magic doesn't happen automatically, the implementation of **SetName** should trigger **NameChanged** approppriately.

The property could also be readonly, or not associated with an event.

Auto-property is very useful to avoid boiler-plate code.

Auto-property must be initialized.

### Full-featured property

``` class WithProp { prop Name: string = "" {} } ``` which means: ``` class WithProp { var name: string = ""; event NameChanged(); func GetName(): string { return name; } func SetName(value: string): void { if (name != value) { name = value; NameChanged(); } } prop Name: string {GetName, SetName : NameChanged} } ``` Note that **name** is not accessible if this variable is generated by auto-property.

### Readonly property

``` class WithProp { prop Name: string = "" {const} } ``` which means: ``` class WithProp { var name: string = ""; event NameChanged(); func GetName(): string { return name; } func SetName(value: string): void { if (name != value) { name = value; NameChanged(); } } prop Name: string {GetName : NameChanged} } ``` Note that **name** is not accessible if this variable is generated by auto-property.

Even this property is readonly, but **SetName** is still generated, because this is the only way to modify the property. **SetName** becomse **protected** in generated C++ code, so calling this function outside of this class will result in wrong C++ code.

### Without event

``` class WithProp { prop Name: string = "" {not observe} } ``` which means: ``` class WithProp { var name: string = ""; func GetName(): string { return name; } func SetName(value: string): void { name = value; } prop Name: string {GetName, SetName} } ``` Note that **name** is not accessible if this variable is generated by auto-property.

### Readonly property without event

``` class WithProp { prop Name: string = "" {const, not observe} } ``` which means: ``` class WithProp { var name: string = ""; func GetName(): string { return name; } func SetName(value: string): void { name = value; } prop Name: string {GetName} } ``` Note that **name** is not accessible if this variable is generated by auto-property.

Even this property is readonly, but **SetName** is still generated, because this is the only way to modify the property. **SetName** becomes **protected** in generated C++ code, so calling this function outside of this class will result in wrong C++ code.

## Using events

Events in classes behaves exactly the same as [events in interfaces.](../.././workflow/lang/interface_prop.md)
