# Classes

Classes can be defined in **modules**, **namespaces**, **classes** and **interfaces**.

A class is a type that contains data and behaviors. It can be allocated directly, without having to be implemented like interfaces.

A class can inherit from other classes, but it cannot override virtual members in base classes. A class cannot define virtual members in Workflow script. So **override** is not allowed for all members in classes.

Unlike C++, all members in classes are public. But you can change access controls for members in [generated C++ code](../.././workflow/codegen.md).

Variables, methods, properties, events, constructors and destructors are allowed in classes.

Static methods, classes, interfaces, enums are allowed in classes, they are accessed by **TYPE::MEMBER** outside of the class.

Unlike interfaces, a class does not control whether it should be created and held by a shared pointer or a raw pointer, this is controlled by individual constructors. When there is no contructor, **new(){}** will be added to the class automatically, which allocate the class in a shared pointer.

A class could also be a [state machine](../.././workflow/lang/state.md).

``` module sampleModule; class Counter { var counter: int = 0; func Increase(): int { counter = counter + 1; return counter; } } func main(): string { var counter = new Counter^(); var r = ""; for (i in range [0, 10)) { r = r & $"$(counter.Increase()); "; } return r; } ```

The default contructor is not defined, so **new(){}** is added to the class when compiling. This makes **new Counter^()** a legal expression to allocate this class. Meanwhile, **new Counter*()** is not allowed, unless **new*(){}** is explicitly declared in the class.

The type of **counter** becomes **Counter^**. You don't need to call **delete counter;**, the object will be deleted automatically when the last shared pointer is out of scope.

Now we call **counter.Increase()** 10 times, which generates numbers from 1 to 10. Function **main** returns **"1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10; "**.
