# State Machines

A state machine works like a coroutine, but unlike coroutine which only has **Resume**, a state machine could have multiple strong-typed inputs.

A state machine is a class. It must inherit from **system::StateMachine** The last member must be **$state_machine { ... }**.

A state machine defines multiple states with arguments. The entry state is called **default**. **$goto_state** and **$push_state** could be use for jump between states.

A state machine defines multiple strong-typed inputs. The state machine is driven by input. When a **$switch** state is executed, it waits for selected inputs. A required input method must be called to resume the state machine.

Let's start with an example: ``` module sampleModule; using system::*; class MySM : StateMachine { prop Output: string = "" {not observe} func Append(text: string): void { Output = $"$(Output)$(text); "; } $state_machine { $state_input A(name: string); $state_input B(name: string); $state WaitForName() { $switch () { case A(name): { Append($"A($(name))"); } case B(name): { Append($"B($(name))"); } } } $state default() { Append("First line"); $push_state WaitForName(); Append("Last line"); } } } func main(): string { var sm = new MySM^(); try { sm.A("John"); sm.B("Smith"); } catch (ex) { sm.Append(ex.Message); } return sm.Output; } ``` The **main** function returns **"First line; A(John); Last line; The state machine has been stopped.; "**.

- **new MySM^()** is executed, the state machine is not started. - **sm.A("John");** is executed. Because this is the first time a **$state_input** is called, the state machine starts. - The entry state of a state machine is **default**, it immediately enters **$state default()**. **"First line; "** is printed. - **$push_state WaitForName()** is executed, it jumps to **$state WaitForName()**. - It is supposed to stop at **$switch**. But because **A** has not been consumed, the state machine continues and choose **case A(name):**. **"A(John)"** is printed. - Now **$state WaitForName()** finishes. Because the state machine jumps to this state via **$push_state**, so it still needs to go back to **$state default**. **"Last line;"** is printed. - The state machine stops. - **sm.B("Smith");** is executed, because the state machines has stopped, it throws an exception.

**$state** defines states. **$state_input** defines inputs from outside. State machines have more freedom in exchanging data comparing to coroutines.
