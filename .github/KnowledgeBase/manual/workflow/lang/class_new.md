# Allocating (class)

New class expressions are the only way to allocate classes.

A new class expression could allocate a class by calling the a class constructor, the constructor decides to return a shared pointer or a raw pointer. ``` class MyClass { new(x:int){} new*(x:string){} delete{} } func main(): void { var a = new MyClass^(0); var b = new MyClass*(""); delete b; } ``` - The first constructor accepts an integer and returns a shared pointer, **new MyClass^(0)** allocate **MyClass** and execute this constructor, **new MyClass*(0)** is illegal. - The second constructor accepts an string and returns a raw pointer, **new MyClass*("")** allocate **MyClass** and execute this constructor, **new MyClass^("")** is illegal. - **a** is held by a shared pointer, **delete (cast MyClass* a);** will throw an exception. - **b**is not held by any shared pointer, so **delete b;** is necessary to prevent from memory leaks. - The destructor **delete{}** will be executed for both **a**, when **a** is out of scope. - The destructor **delete{}** will be executed for both **b**, when **delete b;**.

It crashes if you call a member on a deleted object.

It crashes if you **delete** an object that hold by shared pointers.

Where there is no constructor in a class, **new(){}** will be automatically added to this class, which takes no argument and returns a shared pointer.

There cannot be more than one destructor in a class.
