# Coroutines

There are two kinds of coroutines: - Raw Coroutine - Coroutine Function

Coroutine creates a piece of code that can be paused and resumed as expected, so that this piece of code could receive multiple inputs and produce multiple outputs.

## Raw Coroutine

Raw coroutine is an expression which looks like: ``` $coroutine{ ... } ``` This expression returns **system::Coroutine^**.

See [Raw Coroutine](../.././workflow/lang/coroutine_raw.md).

## Coroutine function

Coroutine function (including lambda expressions) is written in these forms: ``` func ... : void $NAME { ... } ``` or ``` func ... : Something $NAME { ... } ``` or ``` func ... : Something ${ ... } ```

There are two predefines coroutine in Workflow: - [$Async](../.././workflow/lang/coroutine_async.md) - [$Enumerable](../.././workflow/lang/coroutine_enumerable.md)

## Determine the coroutine provider for a coroutine function

Consider the following coroutine function: ``` func ... : TYPE $NAME { ... } ``` - When **$NAME** has a name, the coroutine provider is determined by the coroutine name **That**. - When **$NAME** does not has a name (written as **$**), the coroutine provider is determined by the return type **TYPE**. It generates an error when **TYPE** is **void**.

### Searching by return type

Consider the following coroutine: ``` module sampleModule; using system::*; $interface StringAsync : Async<string>; func DoAsync(): StringAsync $ { ... } ```

The coroutine provider to use is determined like this: - The coroutine does not have a name, because the function body starts with **${**, so the coroutine is searched by return type. - The return type is **StringAsync^**, list this type with all parent types in the breadth-first order. - **::StringAsync** - **::system::Async** - **::system::Interface** - Append **"Coroutine"** after the type name: - **::StringAsyncCoroutine** - **::system::AsyncCoroutine** - **::system::InterfaceCoroutine** - The first existing type is **::system::AsyncCoroutine**, pick this one.

### Searching by coroutine name

Consider the following coroutine: ``` module sampleModule; using system::*; func DoAsync(): void $Async { ... } ```

The coroutine provider to use is determined like this: - The coroutine has a name, it is **Async**. - Search for **Async** in the context, we get **::system::Async**. - Append **"Coroutine"** after the type name: **::system::AsyncCoroutine**. - It exists, pick this one. - If the previous step fails, search for **AsyncCoroutine** in the context.
