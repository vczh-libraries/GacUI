# Design Your Own Coroutine

A coroutine provider is a class with methods that following a naming convention.

A coroutine provider could be written in either C++ with reflection, or just Workflow.

## Naming your coroutine

If you want a coroutine to be written in this way: ``` func MyCoroutine(): void $Foo { /* ... */ } ``` you need to define the coroutine provider like this: ``` using system::*; class FooCoroutine { class InternalState { /* ... */ } static CreateAndRun(creator: func(InternalState*): (Coroutine^)): void { /* ... */ } } ```

If you want a coroutine to be written in this way: ``` func MyCoroutine(): Foo^ ${ /* ... */ } ``` or ``` $interface StringFoo : Foo<string>; func MyCoroutine(): StringFoo^ ${ /* ... */ } ``` you need to define the coroutine provider like this: ``` using system::*; interface Foo { /* ... */ } class FooCoroutine { class InternalState { /* ... */ } static Create(creator: func(InternalState*): (Coroutine^)): Foo^ { /* ... */ } } ```

- **FooCoroutine::InternalState** could be a class or an interface. - **Create** and **CreateAndRun** could both appear. This makes coroutine functions being able to return both **void** and **Foo^**. - The return type of **Create** must be compatible with the return type of coroutine functions: - If **Create** returns **Foo^**, then coroutine functions could return **Foo^** or any of its base type. - If **Create** returns **Foo^**, then coroutine functions could return a generic version of **Foo^**. - The only argument of **Create** or **CreateAndRun** should be a function: - It takes a raw pointer of an object for storing internal states. - It must return **Coroutine^**.

When a coroutine function is called, either **Create** or **CreateAndRun** will be called. You are responsible to create the object for storing internal states, and then a **Coroutine^** will be given to you.

The coroutine function takes and stores the internal state object. When any method in the coroutine provider is called because of coroutine providers, **return** or **$**, this object will be used as the first argument.

Nothing in the coroutine function is executed before the first call to **Coroutine::Resume**.

Whenever a coroutine operation is called, the coroutine pauses, and another call to **Coroutine::Resume** is required to continue the coroutine function.

After **Coroutine::Resume** is called, **Coroutine::Failure** and **Coroutine::Status** must be read in order to correctly handle coroutine operations.

## Define coroutine operations

If you want to support ``` $Do1; $Do2 something; $Do3 something, otherthings; ``` you are required to add the following methods to your coroutine provider: ``` static Do1AndPause(internalState: InternalState*): void { /* ... */ } static Do2AndPause(internalState: InternalState*, something: Something): void { /* ... */ } static Do3AndPause(internalState: InternalState*, something: Something, otherthings: Otherthings): void { /* ... */ } ```

If you want to support both ``` $Do1; $Do2 something; $Do3 something, otherthings; ``` and ``` var x = $Do1; var y = $Do2 something; var z = $Do3 something, otherthings; ``` you are required to add the following methods to your coroutine provider: ``` static Do1AndRead(internalState: InternalState*): void { /* ... */ } static Do2AndRead(internalState: InternalState*, something: Something): void { /* ... */ } static Do3AndRead(internalState: InternalState*, something: Something, otherthings: Otherthings): void { /* ... */ } ```

Overloading is allowed.

When a coroutine operation is called, one of these methods will be called, and the created **Coroutine^** will pause right after that.

All methods for coroutine operations must return **void**. After the coroutine is resumed, the return value from the coroutine operation comes from the second argument in **Coroutine::Resume**.

This argument is a **CoroutineResult^**. - If the coroutine operation succeeds, the return value is stored in the **Result** property. - If the coroutine operation succeeds, the exception is stored in the **Failure** property. - If **Failure** is not null, **Result** will be ignored. and an exception is thrown. If there is no **try-catch** in this coroutine function, the coroutine stops immediately with this exception.

## Define the return statement

If you want to support ``` return; ``` you are required to add this method to your coroutine provider: ``` static ReturnAndExit(internalState: InternalState*): void { /* ... */ } ```

If you want to support ``` return something; ``` you are required to add this method to your coroutine provider: ``` static ReturnAndExit(internalState: InternalState*, something: Something): void { /* ... */ } ```

Both methods could appear together.

When **return** is called, **ReturnAndExit** will be called, and the coroutine stops immediately.

## Define the $ expression

If you want to suppor the **$** expression, you are required to add this method to your coroutine provider: ``` static QueryContext(internalState: InternalState*): Something { /* ... */ } ``` and the return value from **$** becomes **Something**.

## Example

Let's see the example [here](../.././workflow/lang/interface_using.md).

The **ReaderCoroutine** defines: - **$Set values;**: Stores a collection of values. - **var x = $Get;**: Read a value from the stored collection, returns **null** after all values are read. - **return value;**: Finish the coroutine with a result.

After the coroutine pauses, you need to know which coroutine operation is called. In this example, the **readObject** field in **ReaderCoroutine::Executer** is used for this purpose.

In **ReaderCoroutine::Executor::Continue**, when **readObject** is **true**, it means **$Get** is called. The default value of **cr.Result** is **null**. If all values are read, the assignment is not executed, so **$Get** returns **null**.

If **$Get** is called before **$Set**, it crashes because the **enumerator** field is **null**.

After that, **co.Resume(false, cr);** is called, this is how the return value from **$Get** is specified.

Finally **Sum** is called, it first stores 10 numbers, and then read them out one by one, and add them together.

In the **main** function, it keeps calling **ReaderCoroutine::Executor::Continue** until the whole coroutine function finishes. The return value is read from the **result** field, because **ReturnAndExit** use this field to store the value given to the return statement.

By executing **main**, methods in **ReaderCoroutine** is called in the following order: - **Create** - **Executor::Continue** - **SetAndPause** - Call 10 times: - **Executor::Continue** - **GetAndRead** - **Executor::Continue** - **ReturnAndExit**
