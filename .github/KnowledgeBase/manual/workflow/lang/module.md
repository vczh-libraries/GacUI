# Module

Any Workflow script file should be a module, written as: ``` module NAME; using system::*; using presentation::compositions::Gui*Composition; /* ... */ ```

The module name does not matter, but when multiple files are given to the compiler to build an assembly, module names in this assembly are require to be unique.

## Using declaration

A **using** declaration imports names in this module.

**using system::*;** means that names under the namespace **system** can be used directly. For example, you can use **system::DateTime** in a module. But writing the namespace everywhere is annoying, so when **using system::*** appears in a module, you can use **DateTime** directly.

The wildcard is not required to be a complete name. When you have GacUI types`missing document: /home/registered/gacui.html` loaded, **presentation::compositions::GuiTableComposition** is available. But this name is too long, even **GuiTableComposition** is too long. Now when **using presentation::compositions::Gui*Composition;** appears in a module, you can use **Table** for that type.

Because when you replace the wildcard by **Table**, it becomes **presentation::compositions::GuiTableComposition**, which is exactly the full name of the type.

Sometimes wildcards could create ambiguity, for example, ``` using presentation::compositions::Gui*Composition; using presentation::controls::Gui*; using presentation::templates::Gui*Template; ``` When we try to use **Window** in this module, the compiler founds that all following types - presentation::compositions::GuiWindowComposition - presentation::controls::GuiWindow - presentation::templates::GuiWindowTemplate exist, it cannot determine which type to use, so an error is generated.

In order to resolve this issue, you are able to just use the full name, or **GuiWindow** if **using presentation::controls::*** appears in the module, or even **controls::GuiWindow** if **using presentation::*** appears in the module.

## Namespace declaration

You can create namespace by yourself like this: ``` module test; using system::*; namespace mynamespace { namespace another { func MyFunc(): string { return "Hello, world!"; } } } ``` Namespaces are allowed to be nested.

**IMPORTANT**: **using** declarations are not allowed to be in namespaces. In fact they should be declared before any other declarations, right below the module name.

## Static Initialization

Static initialization are statements in **static {}** declarations. Multiple **static {}** declarations could appear in a module or a namespace. Statemenets inside them will be executed when the module is loaded.

When loading and executing workflow script in runtime, such initialization happens when running the [<initialize>](../.././workflow/running/running.md) function, after global variables are initialized.

The execution order between multiple **static {}** declarations are not defined.
