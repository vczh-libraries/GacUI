# Inheritance (class)

A class can inherit multiple classes.

When Derived inherits from Base, - Interfaces cannot inherit classes in Workflow script (this could happen in C++). - Classes cannot inherit interfaces in Workflow script (this could happen in C++). - **Derived** inherits all members from **Base**. - If the same method signature appears in multiple base classes, it will result in ambiguity when calling them. - If members in base classes share the same name with members in the derived class, members in base classes will never be considered as candidates. - You cannot call members of **Derived** on an object of type **Base**, even if it is or inherits **Derived**. - Constructors of base classes must be called by all constructors in the derived class, except default constructors of base classes.

``` module sampleModule; using system::reflection::*; class Base { prop Number: int = 0 {} new() { } new(number: int) { Number = number; } } class Derived : Base { @cpp:Private var r: string = ""; @cpp:Private var handler: EventHandler^ = null; @cpp:Protected func OnNumberChanged(): void { r = r & $"$(Number); "; } new(number: int) :Base(number) { handler = attach(NumberChanged, OnNumberChanged); } delete { detach(NumberChanged, handler); } func GetResult(): string { return r; } prop Result: string {GetResult} } func main(): string { var d = new Derived^(100); var number = d.Number; d.Number = 200; d.Number = 300; return $"$(number); $(d.Result)"; } ``` - **Derived** inherits from **Base**. - The constructor of **Derived** calls the constructor of **Base**. They don't have to be both **new** or **new***. - **delete** is the destructor, which will be called before a **Derived** object is deleted. - **@cpp:Private** and **@cpp:Protected** don't affect Workflow code, it only control how C++ code is generated. - The type of **d** is **Derived^**. - Function **main** returns **"100; 200; 300; "**.
