# \<Instance\>

After a **GacUI XML Resource** is converted to a resource binary: - This resource does not exist in the resource binary. - The equivalent Workflow script will be included in the Workflow assembly part in the resource binary. - If you use the one specified in **GacGenConfig/Cpp**, the Workflow assembly is also not included in the resource binary, because you are supposed to use the generated C++ code.

**\<Instance/\>** creates a derived class inheriting from a base class which is specified by the root object. Any [inheritable class](../.././workflow/running/invoking3.md) with a default constructors could be derived by a **\<Instance/\>**.

You can use **\<Instance/\>** to create classes inheriting from: - A window. - A tab page. - A custom control. - A control template. - A theme. - Another **\<Instance/\>**. - Any other inheritable class, even it is defined in a **\<Script/\>**.

Typically, an **\<Instance/\>** looks like: ``` <Instance name="MainWindowResource"> <Instance ref.CodeBehind="false" ref.Class="helloworld::MainWindow"> <!-- multiple -->    <ref.Parameter .../> <!-- multiple -->    <ref.LocalizedStrings .../> <!-- zero or one --> <ref.Members> <![CDATA[  ...  ]]<![CDATA[></ref.Members> <!-- zero or one --> <ref.Ctor>    <![CDATA[ {...} ]]<![CDATA[></ref.Ctor> <!-- zero or one --> <ref.Dtor>    <![CDATA[ {...} ]]<![CDATA[></ref.Dtor> <Window Text="Hello, world!" ClientSize="x:480 y:320"> <att.BoundsComposition-set PreferredMinSize="x:480 y:320"/> <Label Text="Welcome to GacUI Library!"/> </Window> </Instance> </Instance> ```

Here are tags that can be put before the root object: - **\<ref.Parameter/\>**: A constructor parameter and readonly property. - **\<ref.LocalizedStrings/\>**: Adding a string resource to the current instance, please check out [<LocalizedStrings>](../.././gacui/xmlres/tag_localizedstrings.md). - **\<ref.Members/\>**: Multiple Workflow class members that will be added to the created class. - **\<ref.Ctor/\>**: A Workflow statement containing code that will be executed in the constructor after the instance is created. - **\<ref.Dtor/\>**: A workflow statement containing code that will be executed in the destructor.

You can define as many **\<ref.Parameter/\>** as you want in an **\<Instance/\>**. For item template, there must be exactly one **\<ref.Parameter/\>** to access the item object. For grid visualizer and grid editor, **RowValue** and **CellValue** properties to access the item object. To inherit from an object with **\<ref.Parameter/\>**, assign all of them like normal properties.

There are two attributes for **\<ref.Parameter/\>**: - **Name**: The name of the constructor parameter. It can be used inside the root object. - **Class**: The type of the constructor parameter. If it is a class or an interface, unless [all constructors return raw pointers](../.././workflow/lang/class_new.md), it becomes a shared pointer to the type.

Here are attributes for an **\<Instance/\>**: - **ref.CodeBehind**: true or false. If it is true, an extra pair of C++ files will be created specifically for this instance. - **ref.Class**: The class name for this instance. Namespaces are separated by "::". - **ref.Styles**: Apply one or multiple [<InstanceStyle>](../.././gacui/xmlres/tag_instancestyle.md) on objects in this instance. - **xmlns**: Default namespaces. If it is not specified, it will be: ``` presentation::controls::Gui*; presentation::elements::Gui*Element; presentation::compositions::Gui*Composition; presentation::compositions::Gui*; presentation::templates::Gui*; system::*; system::reflection::*; presentation::*; presentation::Gui*; presentation::controls::*; presentation::controls::list::*; presentation::controls::tree::*; presentation::elements::*; presentation::elements::Gui*; presentation::elements::text::*; presentation::compositions::*; presentation::templates::*; presentation::theme::* ``` Multiple namespaces are separated by ";". The format is similar to [Workflow's using declaration](../.././workflow/lang/module.md). - **xmlns:NAME**: Specify namespaces for **NAME**, so that you can use **NAME:TYPE** for types that are not in default namespaces. Custom namespaces are available in tag names for objects or control/item template properties. Multiple namespaces are separated by ";". The format is similar to [Workflow's using declaration](../.././workflow/lang/module.md).

Here are attributes for any object inside a **\<Instance/\>**: - **ref.Name**: Create a private field in this instance holding this object, so that it can be accessed by Workflow code or bindings.

Here are context attributes for any object inside a **\<Instance/\>**: - **env.ItemName**. - **env.ItemType**. These are for data binding for list items, please check out [Properties](../.././gacui/xmlres/instance/properties.md) and [Data Bindings](../.././gacui/advanced/bindings.md).
