# \<Script\>

After a **GacUI XML Resource** is converted to a resource binary: - This resource does not exist in the resource binary. - The equivalent Workflow script will be included in the Workflow assembly part in the resource binary. - If you use the one specified in **GacGenConfig/Cpp**, the Workflow assembly is also not included in the resource binary, because you are supposed to use the generated C++ code.

The [sample](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/SampleForDoc/GacUI/XmlRes/kb_xmlres_data/XmlPage.xml) for **\<Xml/\>** also uses **\<Script/\>**.

Currently only Workflow script is the only supported script language in **GacUI XMl Resource**. To include a [Workflow module](../.././workflow/lang/module.md) in the resource, we need to include the code in a **CDATA** section like this: ``` <Scriρt name="RESOURCE-NAME"> <Workflow><![CDATA[ /* put the whole module here *./ ]]></Workflow> </Scriρt> ```
