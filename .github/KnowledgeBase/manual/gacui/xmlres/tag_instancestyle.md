# \<InstanceStyle\>

After a **GacUI XML Resource** is converted to a resource binary: - This resource does not exist in the resource binary. - **\<Instance/\>** using this **\<InstanceStyle/\>** will copy everything from styles to instances. Styles itself doesn't generate Workflow scripts.

**\<InstanceStyle/\>** is used to make the code looks clean. It adds attributes to instances by matching instance tags using a query language that looks similar to XPath.

**\<InstanceStyle/\>** works on XML code, it doesn't know the semantic about instances.

To apply styles on instances, put the path of the style in the **ref.Styles** property of those instances. Since styles are not included in the resource binary, it means it cannot be imported, so **res://** is the only valid way to use styles.

Multiple paths are separated by ";" in **ref.Styles**. If they are conflicts between styles, the later win. If some properties in instances conflict with styles, instances win. Unless for collection properties, all values are preserved.

## Path

A path represents a query which returns a collection of GacUI object tags. Sometimes properties and events are also written as tags, but they will not be queried, only objects will.

**/NAME** means one level of direct child tag. A query begins from the root tag. For an instance that is a **\<Window/\>**, **/Window** contains the root instance, but **/CustomControl** returns nothing.

**/Window/Stack/StackItem** is also a valid path, which first find the root instance which is a **\<Window/\>**, and then find all direct children which are **\<Stack/\>**, and then find all direct children in **\<Stack/\>** which are **\<StackItem/\>**.

If you use **//** instead of **/**, any indirect or indirect children of that name will be found.

**NAME** could be in these formats: - **Button**: a tag that looks like **\<Button/\>** or **\<anything:Button/\>**, the namespace doesn't matter. - *****: any tag that is an object. - **Button.buttonSubmit**: a tag that looks like **\<Button ref.Name="buttonSubmit"/\>** or **\<anything:Button ref.Name="buttonSubmit"/\>**, the namespace doesn't matter, but the variable name must match. - ***.buttonSubmit**: a tag with **ref.Name** set to **buttonSubmit**. You can also add **@ATTRIBUTE:** as a prefix of **NAME**, which means this object must be assigned to a property called **ATTRIBUTE**. For example, **//Tab/@Pages:TabPage** only returns all **\<TabPage/\>** that are assigned to the **Pages** property in any **\<Tab/\>**.

The following binary operators are also valid in a path, and you can use **()** to change the precedences: - **A + B**: Union of A and B. - **A * B**: Intersection of A and B. - **A - B**: Objects in A but not in B. - **A ^ B**: Objects that only in A or only in B, equivalents to **(A + B) - (A * B)******* and **^** has a higher precedence than **+** and **-**, but parentheses are always recommended if you feel confused.

## Sample

In [this sample](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/SampleForDoc/GacUI/XmlRes/kb_xmlres_data/TextPage.xml), there is an **\<InstanceStyle/\>**: ``` <InstanceStyle name="SharedStyle"> <Styles> <Style ref.Path="//Stack" AlignmentToParent="left:5 top:5 right:5 bottom:5" Padding="5" Direction="Vertical"/> <Style ref.Path="//Stack + //StackItem" MinSizeLimitation="LimitToElementAndChildren"/> <Style ref.Path="//StackItem/*"> <att.BoundsComposition-set AlignmentToParent="left:0 top:0 right:0 bottom:0"/> </Style> </Styles> </InstanceStyle> ``` A **\<Styles/\>** consists of multiple **\<Style/\>**, any **\<Style/\>** has its own path and properties. In these styles: - **//Stack**: Any **\<Stack/\>**. - **//Stack + //StackItem**: Any **\<Stack/\>** and **\<StackItem/\>**. - **//StackItem/***: Any direct child in **\<StackItem/\>**. Specified properties will be assigned to all objects that described by the path. In this sample, anything that is a direct child of **\<StackItem/\>**, its **BoundsComposition** object will be assigned a property **AlignmentToParent**. So you don't need to write it three times for all three **\<Button/\>** in all three **\<StackItem/\>**
