# Events

There are two ways to handle an event: ``` <Object ev.EVENT1="FUNCTION_NAME"> <ev.EVENT2>FUNCTION_NAME</ev.EVENT2> </Object> ``` Or using data binding: ``` <Object ev.EVENT1-eval="{ ... }"> <ev.EVENT2-eval><![CDATA[ { ... } ]]<![CDATA[></ev.EVENT2-eval> </Object> ```

## By Function

If a function name is assigned to an event, an empty C++ function will be generated.

You are recommended to use **ref.CodeBehind="true"** on the **\<Instance/\>**. By doing this, you will get a separated pair of C++ files for this **\<Instance/\>**. In the cpp file you will see an very obvious place holder for **FUNCTION_NAME**. You can insert anything you want inside this function.

When you change the XML later, **GacBuild.ps1** will recognize your change and merge new generated code with your change.

**IMPORTANT**: - Only changing code in expected places, which will be marked using obvious comments in generated C++ code. Changing to all other places will be lost after running **GacBuild.ps1**. - **GacBuild.ps1** expects "{" and "}" to take the whole line. **DO NOT** put "{" after the previous line.

Please check out [C++ Code Generation](../../.././workflow/codegen.md) for details.

## By Workflow Statement

**-eval** must be used if a [Workflow statement](../../.././workflow/lang/stat.md) is assigned to an event.

If the event is assigned using a tag, **\<![CDATA[ ]]\>** is required to contain the code.

Use a block statement if multiple statements need to be executed for this event.
