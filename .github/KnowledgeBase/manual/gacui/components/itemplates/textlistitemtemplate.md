# \<TextListItemTemplate\>

- **\<TextListItemTemplate/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::templates::GuiTextListItemTemplate*

**\<TextListItemTemplate/\>** derives from **\<ListItemTemplate/\>**. It has the following properties additional to its base class:

## Input Property

### TextColor

This property is assigned by the list control. It comes from the **TextColor** property of **\<TextListTemplate/\>** that applied to the list control.

The list control does not track the changing of the **TextColor** property of **\<TextListTemplate/\>**. If it is changed, **TextColor** of item templates are not changed automatically. But when a list control is assigned with a new control template, **TextColor** of item templates will be updated as well.

### Checked

This property is assigned by the list control. When the item is checked, this property becomes **true**. When the item is unchecked, this property becomes **false**.
