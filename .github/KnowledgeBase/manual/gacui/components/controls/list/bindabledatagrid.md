# \<BindableDataGrid\>

- **\<ComboBox/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiBindableDataGrid* - **Template Tag**: \<ListViewTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: ListView - **Predefined Item Template**: - **SetViewToDefault()** (default): list::DefaultDataGridItemTemplate + list::ListViewColumnItemArranger (which has **ColumnButtons** and **ColumnSplitters** properties if control objects of them are needed)

**\<BindableDataGrid/\>** is an extension to the **Detail** view of list controls. But since it uses different item templates, the **View** property will be **Unknown** by default. You can still switch **View** to other views (including **Detail**) and **\<BindableDataGrid/\>** will just look like a list view. To re-enable data grid features, just call **SetViewToDefault** and **View** will become **Unknown** again.

## DataGrid Features

**\<BindableDataGrid/\>** provides the following features: - `empty list item` **[ Filtering ](../../../.././gacui/components/controls/list/datagrid_filter.md)**: Each column could be attached a **list::IDataFilter**, the data grid itself could be attached a **list::IDataFilter**, all filters will be connected together using **list::DataAndFilter** which works like the C++ **&&** operator. There are also **list::DataOrFilter** and **list::DataNotFilter** to help making a complex filter from other filters. - `empty list item` **[ Sorting ](../../../.././gacui/components/controls/list/datagrid_sorter.md)**: Each column could be attached a **list::IDataSorter**. If a column has a sorter, it is sortable and clicking it will sort data ascendingly, descendingly or cancel the sorting. To sort by column or cancel sorting by code, you could request the **list::IDataGridView** view from the **ItemProvider**, and there will be **IsColumnSortable**, **SortByColumn**, **GetSortedColumn** and **IsSortOrderAscending** to help. - `empty list item` **[ Visualizer ](../../../.././gacui/components/controls/list/datagrid_visualizer.md)**: Each column could be attached a visualizer factory. There are predefined visualizers: - MainColumnVisualizerTemplate - SubColumnVisualizerTemplate - HyperlinkVisualizerTemplate and visualizer decorators: - FocusRectangleVisualizerTemplate - CellBorderVisualizerTemplate A visualizer decorator is still a visualizer, but the data grid control will install other visualizer inside its **ContainerComposition**. The default visualizer factory for cells in the first column is: ** MainColumnVisualizerTemplate;FocusRectangleVisualizerTemplate;CellBorderVisualizerTemplate ** The default visualizer factory for cells in the other columns is: ** SubColumnVisualizerTemplate;FocusRectangleVisualizerTemplate;CellBorderVisualizerTemplate ** It is recommended to use **YOUR_VISUALIZER;FocusRectangleVisualizerTemplate;CellBorderVisualizerTemplate** so that a cell automatically renders a focus rectangle and a border just like other cells. - `empty list item` **[ Editor ](../../../.././gacui/components/controls/list/datagrid_editor.md)**: Each column could be attached an editor factory. If a column has an editor, clicking any cell in this column will activate the editor. The **OpenedEditor** property will be useful if you need to access the editor object.

## Tutorial Project

Please check out [ this page ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/instance/properties.md) about GacUI XML Resource syntax for properties mentioned above.

Please also checkout [ this tutorial project ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Tutorial/GacUI_Controls/DataGrid/UI/Resource.xml) about using **\<BindableDataGrid/\>** features. This project customizes visualizers and editors for different data types, defines sorters for each column, and even implements a data filter in a column drop down.

## Step-by-Step Sample

[ control_datagrid_base ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/SampleForDoc/GacUI/XmlRes/control_datagrid_base/Resource.xml) is a sample for using **\<BindableDataGrid/\>**. It defines a window base class containing a data grid, exposing all **\<DataColumn/\>** for derived window classes to add more configuration.

By specifying **control_datagrid_base;control_datagrid_plaintext** in the [ RunResource ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/tree/master/SampleForDoc/GacUI/RunResource) command line argument, you could run this sample without any data grid feature enabled for a baseline.

**control_datagrid_base** is porting from **control_list_listview_bindable**, it is very easy to find all changes: - **\<BindableListView/\>** is replaced by **\<BindableListView/\>**. - **\<ListViewColumn/\>** is replaced by **\<DataColumn/\>**, each column is given a **ref.Name**. - Adding **ValueProperty** for each column. - The **SelectedItem** property is replaced by **SelectedRowValue**. - Handling **SelectedCellChanged** instead of **SelectionChanged**. - The combo box for changing view is removed. It is very straightforward to move your application from list view to data grid.

In **control_datagrid_plaintext** there is almost nothing, it just creates a **sample::MainWindow** inheriting from **sample::DataGridWindowBase**. In order to reference types created in another resource, **GacGenConfig/Metadata** is required in the GacUI XML Resource. Please check out [ Code Generation Configuration ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/cgc.md) and [ Cross XML Resource References ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/cxrr.md) for details.

In the following feature document pages, different **\<DataColumn/\>** features will be demonstrated by creating different derived window class to add configuration to columns.
