# Sorter

A sorter is an instance of interface **list::IDataSorter**.

When a sorter is installed to the data grid, **SetCallback** will be called. **GetItemProvider** in the callback object provides access to the **ItemProvider** of the data grid. **OnProcessorChanged** in the callback object is called by the sorter, when the sorter definition is changed.

The **Compare** function accepts two items in **ItemSource**. It returns a negative number when **rows1** should appear before **rows2** in ascending order. It returns a positive number when **rows1** should appear after **rows2** in ascending order. It returns 0 when the order is not important.

## Implementing a Sorter

Typically you need to implement the interface directly.

## Predefined Sorter Combinators

**list::DataMultipleSorter**: Combine two sorters into one sorter. If the **LeftSorter** decides an order for two items, that's the order. If the **LeftSorter** decides that the order is not important, the **RightSorter** kicks in.

**list::DataReverseSorter**: This sorter defines a revert order based on another sorter.

## Installing Sorters

Multiple sorters could be assigned to each columns, but only one sorter could be activated. To activate or cancel a sorter, just click the column header, or request the **list::IDataGridView** view from the **ItemProvider** and there will be methods for controlling sorting.

## Step-by-Step Sample

In this demo, sorters are applied to the first three columns: ``` <att.TitleColumn-set Sorter="[Sys::Compare($1.Title, $2.Title)]"/> <att.AuthorColumn-set Sorter="[Sys::Compare($1.Author, $2.Author)]"/> <att.DatePublishedColumn-set Sorter="[Sys::Compare($1.DatePublished, $2.DatePublished)]"/> ```

Each [ sorter function ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/instance/properties.md) is a lambda expression, **$1** and **$2** are the two arguments of this function. argument types are specified by **env.ItemType**, just like filter functions.

Using **-eval** on the **Sorter** property means an **IDataSorter^** is assigned to the property. Setting **Sorter** without any binder means a sorter function is assigned to the property, in this case an **IDataSorter^** is automatically created from this assigned function.
