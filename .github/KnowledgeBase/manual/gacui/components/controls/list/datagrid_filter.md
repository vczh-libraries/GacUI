# Filter

A filter is an instance of interface **list::IDataFilter**.

When a filter is installed to the data grid, **SetCallback** will be called. **GetItemProvider** in the callback object provides access to the **ItemProvider** of the data grid. **OnProcessorChanged** in the callback object is called by the filter, when the filter definition is changed (e.g. a the date range is changed in a filter that only allow items in that range).

The **Filter** function accepts an item from **ItemSource**, it returns **true** when the item satisfies the filter.

## Implementing a Filter

Typically you need to implement the interface directly.

When a filter is semantically designed for a column, a filter could be implemented by a column dropdown. Usually this is done by creating a **\<CustomControl/\>** or a **\<Popup/\>** for the UI in the column dropdown. The control has a **list::IDataFilter** property, whose the implementation talks to the control for filter arguments. In the end, install the filter to both **Filter** and **Popup** in **list::DataColumn**.

Please check out [ this tutorial project ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Tutorial/GacUI_Controls/DataGrid/UI/Resource.xml) for details.

## Predefined Filter Combinators

**list::DataAndFilter**: Combine multiple filters to one filter. An item satisfies this filter when it satisfies all sub filters.

**list::DataOrFilter**: Combine multiple filters to one filter. An item satisfies this filter when it satisfies at least one sub filters.

**list::DataNotFilter**: Convert one filter to another. An item satisfies this filter when it unsatisfies the sub filter.

## Installing Filters

Multiple filters could be assigned to each column. A filter could be assigned to the control using the **AdditionalFilter** property. An item must satisfies **AdditionalFilter** add every filter assigned to columns in order to appear in the control.

## Step-by-Step Sample

In this demo, a control is created for editing a date range using two **\<DateComboBox/\>**, each with a **\<CheckBox/\>** for controlling the condition availability.

In the constructor of this control, a filter is created. It reads the date range from the control to filter a row object (which is **BookItem**).

In the derived main window, the following configuration is added to the **DatePublishedColumn**. Please check out the base class **sample::MainWindow** for details about how a **\<DateColumn/\>** is exposed as a property. ``` <att.DatePublishedColumn-set> <att.Filter-eval>dateFilter.Filter</att.Filter-eval> <att.Popup> <ToolstripMenu> <sample:DateFilter ref.Name="dateFilter"> <att.BoundsComposition-set AlignmentToParent="left:0 top:0 right:0 bottom:0"/> </sample:DateFilter> </ToolstripMenu> </att.Popup> </att.DatePublishedColumn-set> ``` Setting the **Popup** property doesn't automatically apply the filter, the **Filter** property is still needed. Using **-eval** on the **Filter** property means an **IDataFilter^** is assigned to the property. Setting **Filter** without any binder means a [ filter function ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/instance/properties.md) is assigned to the property, in this case an **IDataFilter^** is automatically created from this assigned function.
