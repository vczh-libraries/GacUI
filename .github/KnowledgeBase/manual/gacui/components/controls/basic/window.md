# ControlHost and \<Window\>

- **\<Window/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiWindow* - **Template Tag**: \<WindowTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: Window

**\<Window/\>** is where we start our journey. ``` <Instance ref.CodeBehind="false" ref.Class="demo::MainWindow> <Window ref.Name="self" Text="This is the main window" ClientSize="x:640 y:480"> <att.BoundsComposition-set PreferredMinSize="x:480 y:320"> <!-- Here to put contents inside a window --> </Window> </Instance> ``` - **\<Window/\>** is a **ControlHost**, which has to be a top-level window, is usually a base class of an [ <Instance> ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/tag_instance.md). Here we create a class **demo::MainWindow** inheriting from **\<Window/\>**. - **ref.CodeBehind** set to **false** so that GacUI doesn't generate a separated pair of C++ source files for this class. - **Text** is the title of this window. - **ClientSize** is the initial size when the window is loaded. This size doesn't include the border and the title. - **BoundsComposition.PreferredMinSize** is the minimum client size of this window. When the window size is being changed by dragging the border, it cannot go smaller than this size.

## Adding something to a window

**\<Window/\>** is just a control. Compositions and controls in the window will be added to its **ContainerComposition**. You don't have to explicitly use **att.ContainerComposition**.

As a **GuiInstanceRootObject**, components can also be added to a window.

Please check out [ this tutorial project ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/tree/master/Tutorial/GacUI_Xml/Instance_Window) for details.

## GuiControlHost Properties

### Focused (WindowGotFocus, WindowLostFocus)

A focused window receives keyboard inputs. It will deliver all inputs to the focused control, except for **ALT** sequence.

### Activated (WindowActivated, WindowDeactivated)

A focused window must be activated.

Calling **SetParent** of a control host's **NativeWindow** makes a becomes another window's sub window.

### ShowInTaskBar

The default value is different in different sub classes.

When this property is set to **true**, a icon (and probably with text) appears in the task bar.

### EnableActivate

The default value for this property is **true**.

When this property is set to **false**, this window is not allowed to be activated by user interaction. But this property will be automatically set to **false** when the window is required to be activated by code. For example, calling **Show** instead of **ShowDeactivated**, or calling **SetActivated**.

### TopMost

The default value for this property is **false**.

When this property is set to **true**, it stays in front of all windows whose **TopMost** is **false**.

### ClientSize

This property is the client size of a window.

The value doesn't change according to DPI or text scaling settings. If text scaling is set to 200%, a 320x240 client size is taking 640x480 pixels in the screen.

### Location

This property is the location of a window.

This value changes acfording to DPI or text scaling settings. The coordinate is in screen space. In a multiple monitors computer, a visible window could have negative numbers in its location.

**SetBounds** could be called to set **Location** and **ClientSize** at the same time.

### TimerManager

This property returns a manager object that runs tasks repeatedly until the task itself tells the manager object to stop.

[ Animations ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/tag_animation.md) are built on top of it.

### Opening

When this property is **true**, the window is visible.

## GuiControlHost Events

### WindowOpened

This event is raised right after a window is visible.

### WindowClosing

This event is raised before a window is closed.

The second argument for this event is a **GuiRequestEventArgs**. By setting the **cancel** field to **true**, it stops then window from being closed.

### WindowReadyToClose

This event is raised right before a window is closed when **WindowClosing** does not cancel the operation.

### WindowClosed

This event is raised right after a window is closed.

### WindowDestroying

This event is raised before a window is being deleted. At this moment, everything in the window is still alive.

## Displaying a GuiControlHost

You could **Show** or **ShowDeactivated** a window without changing its size.

You could also **ShowRestored**, **ShowMaximized** or **ShowMinimized** a window.

To make a window invisible, you could call **Hide** or **Close**. Calling **Close** on the main window cause the application to begin an existing process. These two functions behaves the same for other windows.

## Controlling \<Window\> Border

The following properties control what components should appear in the window's border: - MaximizedBox - MinimizedBox - Border - SizeBox - IconVisible - TitleBar A window's control template could accept or reject such changing by setting the following properties in **\<WindowTemplate/\>**: - MaximizedBoxOption - MinimizedBoxOption - BorderOption - SizeBoxOption - IconVisibleOption - TitleBarOption They could be **AlwaysTrue**, **AlwaysFalse** or **Customizable**.

### Sample

- Source code: [control_basic_window](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/SampleForDoc/GacUI/XmlRes/control_basic_window/Resource.xml) - ![](https://gaclib.net/doc/gacui/control_basic_window.gif)

## Displaying a \<Window\>

The following functions displays a **\<Window/\<** as a sub window: - **ShowModal**: This function makes a window visible as a model window. A model window will disable its owner when it is visible. The second argument will be called as a callback after this window is closed, and then its owner window becomes enabled. - **ShowModalAndDelete**: Just like **ShowModal**, but after it is closed, the window will be deleted. Please check out [ this tutorial project ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/tree/master/Tutorial/GacUI_Xml/Instance_MultipleWindows) for details. It calls this function in C++ by specifying a function name in the button's **Clicked** event. With **ref.CodeBehind="true"**, a place holder is generated in [ this separated file ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Tutorial/GacUI_Xml/Instance_MultipleWindows/UI/Source/MainWindow.cpp). - **ShowModalAsync**: Just like **ShowModal**, but it returns a **system::Async^** (or **Ptr\<reflection::description::IAsync\>** in C++). This function can be used in [$Await](../../../.././workflow/lang/coroutine_async.md), it simplies **Workflow** scripts in GacUI XML Resource a lot. Please check out [ this tutorial project ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Tutorial/GacUI_Controls/AddressBook/UI/Resource.xml) and [ this tutorial project ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Tutorial/GacUI_ControlTemplate/BlackSkin/UI/FullControlTest/DocumentEditorBase.xml) for details. They use **$Await window.ShowModalAsync(mainWindow);** followed by **delete window;** as an alternative way to **ShowModalAndDelete** without involving lambda expressions as callbacks.

## \<Window\>::ClipboardUpdated Event

This event is raised when the content of the clipboard is changed.

It happens before **clipboardNotify** in any composition inside this window.
