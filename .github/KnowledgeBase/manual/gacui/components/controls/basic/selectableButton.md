# GuiSelectableButton

- **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiSelectableButton* - **Template Tag**: \<SelectableButtonTemplate/\> - **\<CheckBox/\>** - **Template Name**: CheckBox - **\<RadioButton/\>** - **Template Name**: RadioButton

**GuiSelectableButton** is a **\<Button/\>** with the ability to be selected.

Usually, **\<CheckBox/\>** represents an independent option, and multiple **\<RadioButton/\>** represent a group of exclusive choices.

## GuiSelectableButton Properties

### AutoSelection (AutoSelectionChanged)

The default value for this property is **true**, but it could be different in sub classes.

When this property is **true**, the **Selected** property reverses when **Clicked** raises, otherwise, the **Selected** property is not changed automatically, but it could be changed by code.

### Selected (SelectedChanged)

The default value for this property is **false**.

This property doesn't change behaviors, it is used to record a selection and tell the control template to render differently.

### GroupController (GroupControllerChanged)

The default value for this property is **null**.

A **GuiSelectableButton::GroupController** instance is required for this property. **GuiSelectableButton::MutexGroupController** is a predefined group controller to make **\<RadioButton/\>** exclusive to each other.

typical steps to create a group of **\<RadioButton/\>**: - Create a namespace mapping if necessary, like **xmlns:x="presentation::controls::GuiSelectableButton::*"** - Create one **\<x:MutexGroupController/\>** for each group of radio buttons, as a component for the current **\<Instance/\>**. - Assign **GroupController** of radio buttons in the same group to the same **\<x:MutexGroupController/\>****NOTE:****"xmlns:x"** is just a name, you can map the namespace to any name you like. If you call it **"xmlns:abc"**, then the controller becomes **\<abc:MutexGroupController/\>**.

Please check out [ this tutorial project ](https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Release/blob/master/Tutorial/GacUI_ControlTemplate/BlackSkin/UI/FullControlTest/TextListTabPage.xml) for **\<CheckBox/\>**, **\<RadioButton/\>** and **\<x:MutexGroupController/\>**

You could create a new class and inherit from **GuiSelectableButton::GroupController** and use it in the **GroupController** property, for a scenario like "only 3 options could be selected", and automatically canceled the oldest option when 4 options are selected. But in order to prevent users from being confused, error messages are recommended instead of changing users' input.
