# \<CustomControl\>

- **\<CustomControl/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiCustomControl* - **Template Tag**: \<ControlTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: CustomControl

**\<CustomControl/\>** is a control for making new controls in GacUI XML Resource. ``` <Instance ref.CodeBehind="false" ref.Class="demo::MyControl> <CustomControl/> </Instance> ``` **\<CustomControl/\>** is usually a base class of an [ <Instance> ](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/tag_instance.md). Here we create a class **demo::MyControl** inheriting from **\<CustomControl/\>**.

To add new properties and other members to the new control, just define them in **Workflow** and put all of them in [<ref.Members/>](../../../.././gacui/xmlres/tag_instance.md).

To make such control focusable, use the **FocusableComposition** to specify a composition to receive keyboard and other related events.

## Adding something to a custom control

**\<CustomControl/\>** is just a control. Compositions and controls in the window will be added to its **ContainerComposition**. You don't have to explicitly use **att.ContainerComposition**.

As a **GuiInstanceRootObject**, components can also be added to a window.
