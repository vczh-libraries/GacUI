# Grouping Multiple \<ToolstripButton\>

- **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiControl* - **Template Tag**: \<ControlTemplate/\> - **\<MenuSplitter/\>** - **Template Name**: MenuSplitter - **\<ToolstripSplitter/\>** - **Template Name**: ToolstripSplitter

- **\<ToolstripGroupContainer/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiToolstripGroupContainer* - **Template Tag**: \<ControlTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: CustomControl

- **\<ToolstripGroup/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiToolstripGroup* - **Template Tag**: \<ControlTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: CustomControl

All toolstrip button containers have a **ToolstripItems** property. This property is the default property for them in GacUI XML Resource, which means direct child controls inside these containers are all added to this property.

Invisible toolstrip items in **ToolstripItems** are not rendered and take zero space, but they are in the toolstrip button container.

Predefined toolstrip button containers are: - **\<ToolstripMenu/\>** - **\<ToolstripMenuBar/\>** - **\<ToolstripToolBar/\>** - **\<ToolstripGroupContainer/\>** - **\<ToolstripGroup/\>** Recommended controls in these containers are: - **\<ToolstripButton/\>** or proper virtual controls - **\<ToolstripGroupContainer/\>** - **\<ToolstripGroup/\>**

A **\<ToolstripGroup/\>** organizes toolstrip items horizontally or vertically according to which toolstrip button container it is in.

A **\<ToolstripGroupContainer/\>** organizes toolstrip items horizontally or vertically according to which toolstrip button container it is in. It will choose a proper theme to create splitters between items, unless **SplitterTemplate** is assigned.

When a toolstrip button is put inside a toolstrip button container, their relation is built, and features are automatically available, like **ALT** sequence handling, or open sub menu when moving the mouse cursor while a ancestor toolstrip button is clicked and activated.

So it doesn't need to worry about how a toolstrip button is put inside a toolstrip button container. For example, you could wrap a toolstrip button in an item template, and assign this item template to a **\<RepeatFlow/\>** inside a **\<CustomControl/\>**, and finally add the **\<CustomControl/\>** to the **ToolstripItems** property of a toolstrip button container (in GacUI XML Resource you don't need to use **ToolstripItems** explicitly). Now you created a bindable menu item list in a menu!

**IMPORTANT**: **\<ToolstripGroupContainer/\>** will always create splitters no matter whether some toolstrip items are visible or invisible. When there is an item in **\<ToolstripGroupContainer/\>** that consist only bindable menu item list, you need to remove it from **\<ToolstripGroupContainer/\>** if it contains no item, just setting its **Visible** to **false** doesn't work.
