# \<DocumentViewer\>

- **\<DocumentViewer/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiDocumentViewer* - **Template Tag**: \<DocumentViewerTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: DocumentViewer

**\<GuiDocumentViewer/\>** is a **GuiScrollContainer**. The control template doesn't need to care about rendering characters. When it is installed to the control, a fully managed **GuiDocumentElement** will be installed to the **ContainerComposition** of the control template.

**\<CommonScrollViewLook/\>** is very useful to implement the control template.

**\<GuiDocumentViewer/\>** provides both horizontal and vertical scroll bars. When a paragraph is too long to display, auto line-wrapping is automatically done so that the horizontal scroll bar is always not needed. But such default behavior can be changed.
