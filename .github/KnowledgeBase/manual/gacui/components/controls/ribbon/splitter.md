# \<RibbonSplitter\>

- **\<RibbonSplitter/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiControl* - **Template Tag**: \<ControlTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: RibbonSplitter

**\<RibbonSplitter/\>** splits controls in **\<RibbonGroup/\>**.

For example, **\<RibbonButtons/\>** groups every three buttons together, but there is no splitter between buttons. In order to create a visible splitter in a **\<RibbonButtons/\>** of six buttons, a **\<RibbonSplitter/\>** is put between two **\<RibbonButtons/\>**, each having three buttons.

If a button never changes into smaller size, **\<RibbonLargeButton/\>**, **\<RibbonLargeDropdownButton/\>** and **\<RibbonLargeSplitButton/\>** are recommended to put in **\<RibbonGroup/\>** directly, instead of putting multiple **\<ToolstripButton/\>** in one **\<RibbonButtons/\>**, having both **MaxSize** and **MinSizee** set to **Large**.

Typically, **\<RibbonSplitters/\>** is designed for split buttons, since **\<RibbonToolstrips/\>** and **\<BindableRibbonGalleryList/\>** are recommended to have exclusive **\<RibbonGroup/\>** for each of them.
