# \<RibbonGroup\>

- **\<RibbonGroup/\>** - **C++/Workflow**: (vl::)presentation::controls::GuiRibbonGroup* - **Template Tag**: \<RibbonGroupTemplate/\> - **Template Name**: RibbonGroup

A **\<RibbonTabPage/\>** has three properties: - **Expendable**: Set to **true** and a small expanding button appears at the bottom-right corner. The **ExpandButtonClicked** event raises when this button is clicked. - **LargeImage**: Assign a large icon to this property, when there is no space to render the whole **\<RibbonTabPage/\>** in its smallest size, it becomes a button. - **Items**: All sub controls in this **\<RibbonTabPage/\>**. The following controls are recommended in **Items**, but you could put whatever you want: - Vertical splitters between two controls in a group: **\<RibbonSplitter/\>**. - Large version of **\<ToolstripButton/\>**: **\<RibbonLargeButton/\>**, **\<RibbonLargeDropdownButton/\>** and **\<RibbonLargeSplitButton/\>**. - Buttons that change their sizes automatically: **\<RibbonButtons/\>** - Toolbars that reorganize itself automatically: **\<RibbonToolstrips/\>** - Gallery list controls with additional menu items: **\<BindableRibbonGalleryList/\>**
