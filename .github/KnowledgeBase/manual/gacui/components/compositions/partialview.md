# \<PartialView\>

**\<PartialView/\>** sticks its location and size to a ratio of the location and size of its parent composition.

**\<PartialView/\>** is not a **\<Bounds/\>**, there is no writable **ExpectedBounds** and **AlignmentToParent** in this composition.

**Margin** of this composition and **InternalMargin** of its parent composition are ignored.

One of the scenario for **\<PartialView/\>** is the moving handle of a scroll bar.

## \<PartialView\>::WidthRatio and \<PartialView\>::WidthPageSize

The default value of **WidthRatio** is **0.0**.

The default value of **WidthPageSize** is **1.0**.

- Value for **WidthRatio** should be in **[0, 1]** - Value for **WidthPageSize** should be in **[0, 1]** - **WidthRatio** + **WidthPageSize** should not exceed 1

These properties define the location and size of this composition in the following way: - The distance between this composition to the left border of its parent composition is **WidthRatio** * "width of its parent composition". - The width of this composition is **WidthPageSize** * "width of its parent composition".

## \<PartialView\>::HeightRatio and \<PartialView\>::HeightPageSize

The default value of **HeightRatio** is **0.0**.

The default value of **HeightPageSize** is **1.0**.

- Value for **HeightRatio** should be in **[0, 1]** - Value for **HeightPageSize** should be in **[0, 1]** - **HeightRatio** + **HeightPageSize** should not exceed 1

These properties define the location and size of this composition in the following way: - The distance between this composition to the left border of its parent composition is **HeightRatio** * "height of its parent composition". - The height of this composition is **HeightPageSize** * "height of its parent composition".
