# \<SharedSizeRoot\> and \<SharedSizeItem\>

**\<SharedSizeRoot/\>** synchronizes **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** in it to have the same widths or heights.

**\<SharedSizeItem/\>** doesn't have to be a direct child of **\<SharedSizeRoot/\>**.

One of a useful secenario is to create control templates for menu items. **\<SharedSizeRoot/\>** is put in the container for menu items, **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** is put in the control template for each menu item. When menu items are added in the container, All **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** becomes (indirect) child compositions of the **\<SharedSizeRoot/\>**, and then widths for names and shortcut keys are synchronized.

This is why menu items are aligned like a table even when each pair of name and shortcut key are in separate controls.

## \<SharedSizeItem\>::Group

The default value is **an empty string**.

Only **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** in the same **Group** synchronizes size between each other. Two **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** in different **Group** do not affect each other.

If this **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** is not a child composition of a **\<SharedSizeRoot/\>**, sizes are not synchronized with any others.

If this **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** is a child composition of multiple **\<SharedSizeRoot/\>** and **\<SharedSizeItem/\>**, - If the nearest parent composition amnong them is a **\<SharedSizeItem/\>**, sizes are not synchronized with any others. - If the nearest parent composition amnong them is a **\<SharedSizeRoot/\>**, sizes are only synchronized with other valid **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** in this **\<SharedSizeRoot/\>**.

## \<SharedSizeItem\>::SharedWidth

The default value is **false**.

If **SharedWidth** is set to true, this **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** synchronizes its width with other **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** in the same **Group**.

## \<SharedSizeItem\>::SharedHeight

The default value is **false**.

If **SharedWidth** is set to true, this **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** synchronizes its height with other **\<SharedSizeItem/\>** in the same **Group**.
