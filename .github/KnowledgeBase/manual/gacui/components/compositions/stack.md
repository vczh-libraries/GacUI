# \<Stack\> and \<StackItem\>

**\<Stack/\>** arrange all direct children **\<StackItem/\>** compositions in a line following the same direction.

If all **\<StackItem/\>** lines of horizontally, all of them share the same height. If all **\<StackItem/\>** lines of vertically, all of them share the same width.

**\<StackItem/\>**::MinSizeLimitation is **LimitToElementAndChildren** by default.

## Properties

A few more properties are provided by **\<Stack/\>** and **\<StackItem/\>** to control the details of how to ordering **\<StackItem/\>**.

**\<StackItem/\>** is not a **\<Bounds/\>**, there is no writable **ExpectedBounds** and **AlignmentToParent** in **\<StackItem/\>**.

### \<Stack\>::Direction

The default value is **Horizontal**.

**Horizontal**, **ReversedHorizontal**, **Vertical** and **ReversedVertical** are all valid values for this property, deciding how **\<StackItem/\>** are line up in a **\<Stack/\>**.

### \<Stack\>::Padding

The default value is 0.

This property keeps an distance between each **\<StackItem/\>**.

### \<Stack\>::ExtraMargin

The default value is 0 for all its components.

This property keeps an distance between **\<Stack/\>** and **\<StackItem/\>**.

### \<StackItem\>::ExtraMargin

The default value is 0 for all its components.

This property adds a border to a **\<StackItem/\>**.

**IMPORTANT**: **ExtraMargin** does not affect how **other \<StackItem/\>** is positioned. Instead, after the position of a **\<StackItem/\>** is decided, **ExtraMargin** kicks in and add a border to enlarge it.

Adding an **ExtraMargin** to a **\<StackItem/\>** does not increase the minimum size of its parent **\<Stack/\>**.

## Adding Stack Items

### \<Stack\>::Children()

When a new **\<StackItem/\>** is added to **\<Stack/\>** as a child, this **\<StackItem/\>** is always appended to the end of the line, regardless of its position in **\<Stack\>::Children**.

### \<Stack\>::InsertStackItem(index, item)

To control the position of a **\<StackItem/\>** in a line, call **\<Stack\>::InsertStackItem()** instead of **\<Stack\>::Children()**.

This function also adds a **\<StackItem/\>** to the **\<Stack/\>**, but it allows the position of this **\<StackItem/\>** in a line to be specified, instead of adding it to the end of the line.

### \<Stack\>::GetStackItems()

Call this function to get all direct children **\<StackItem/\>** in the line order.

## Visibility of Stack Items

### \<Stack\>::IsStackItemClipped()

This function returns **false** when any part of any **\<StackItem/\>** is invisible or clipped by this **\<Stack/\>**.

### \<Stack\>::EnsureVisible(index)

When **MinSizeLimitation** of **\<Stack/\>** is not **LimitToElementAndChildren**, it is possible that some **\<StackItem/\>** are not visible because of the **\<Stack/\>** is too small.

This function **"scrolls"** all items to make sure that the specified one is visible.
