# \<ResponsiveFixed\>

**\<ResponsiveFixed/\>** only has one view. If there are some **GuiResponsiveCompositionBase** added as child compositions in **\<ResponsiveFixed/\>**, they are ignored and their views will not change.

**\<ResponsiveFixed/\>** is a **GuiResponsiveCompositionBase** and a **\<Bounds/\>**.

Sometimes you want to just add a static view to **\<ResponsiveView/\>**::**View**, but **Views** requires **GuiResponsiveCompositionBase**. **\<ResponsiveFixed/\>** is designed for this scenario.

## \<ResponsiveFixed\>::Direction

Since **\<ResponsiveFixed/\>** only has one view, this property is ignored.

## \<ResponsiveFixed\>::LevelCount

This property is always 1.

## \<ResponsiveFixed\>::CurrentLevel

This property is always 0.
