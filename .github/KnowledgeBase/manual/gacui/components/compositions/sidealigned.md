# \<SideAligned\>

**\<SideAligned/\>** sticks itself to a border of the parent composition.

**\<SideAligned/\>** is not a **\<Bounds/\>**, there is no writable **ExpectedBounds** and **AlignmentToParent** in this composition.

**Margin** of this composition and **InternalMargin** of its parent composition are ignored.

One of the scenario for **\<SideAligned/\>** is the arrow button of a scroll bar.

## \<SlideAlign\>::Direction

The default value for **Direction** is **Top**. The following are valid values for this property: - **Left**: This makes the composition behaves like its **AlignmentToParent** is **left:0 top:0 right:-1 bottom:0**. Its width is decided by **MaxLength**, **MaxRatio** and the size of its parent composition. - **Top**: This makes the composition behaves like its **AlignmentToParent** is **left:0 top:0 right:0 bottom:-1**. Its height is decided by **MaxLength**, **MaxRatio** and the size of its parent composition. - **Right**: This makes the composition behaves like its **AlignmentToParent** is **left:-1 top:0 right:0 bottom:0**. Its width is decided by **MaxLength**, **MaxRatio** and the size of its parent composition. - **Bottom**: This makes the composition behaves like its **AlignmentToParent** is **left:0 top:-1 right:0 bottom:0**. Its height is decided by **MaxLength**, **MaxRatio** and the size of its parent composition.

## \<SlideAlign\>::MaxLength and \<SlideAlign\>::MaxRatio

The default value for **MaxLength** is **10**.

The default value for **MaxRatio** is **1.0**. Value for this property should be in **[0, 1]**.

When **Direction** is **Left** or **Right**: - let X be **MaxLength**. - let Y be **MaxRatio** * "width of the parent composition". The width of this composition becomes **min(X, Y)**.

When **Direction** is **Top** or **Bottom**: - let X be **MaxLength**. - let Y be **MaxRatio** * "height of the parent composition". The height of this composition becomes **min(X, Y)**.
