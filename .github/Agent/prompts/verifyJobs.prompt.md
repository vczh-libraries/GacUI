# Verify jobsData.ts against prompts

`REPO-ROOT/.github/Agent/packages/CopilotPortal/src/jobsData.ts` contains definition of all tasks and jobs.
Read `REPO-ROOT/.github/Agent/prompts/spec/CopilotPortal/JobsData.md` to understand the specification of jobsData.
You goal is to check all prompts in `jobsData.ts` against all prompt files it mentioned and identify:
- All references to unexisting files.
- All unclear references.
- All typos.
- All logic errors. Most of prompts are telling the agent to follow instructions of other prompt files. You need to read those files and make sure instructions in `jobsData.ts` are consistent with those files.

Fix what you have found in `jobsData.ts` that matches the above list.

Be aware of file paths in `jobsData.ts` prompts:
- When any `REPO-ROOT/.github` folder is mentioned, it is `REPO-ROOT/Copilot` in this repo.
- When any `REPO-ROOT/.github/TaskLogs/*.md` file is mentioned, they do not exist in this repo but they will be generated by prompt files in `REPO-ROOT/Copilot/prompts`.
- When `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` is mentioned, they are `REPO-ROOT/AGENTS.md` in this repo.

## Undestanding Prompt Files

Prompt files mentioned are for developing heavy C++ projects. They are typically be used in the following order:
- `scrum`: Create a scrum board for a big feature, breaking it down into a set of small tasks.
- `design`: Create a design document for a task in the scrum board, or for a task specified directly.
- `plan`: Make detailed plan from the design document.
- `summary`: Summarize all code changes from the plan document.
- `execute` and `verify`: Coding works according to summarized plan.
- `scrum learn` and `refine`: Learn from all created documents for one task. They may contain review comments input from human.

Documents created from the first four steps can be reviewed by a AI team. The process is:
- Call all predefined models to run `review scrum|design|plan|summary`. Each model review the specified document and other models' reviews.
- Once they agree to each other, run `review final` and `review apply`, to update the document under review.
- Human will optionally review the final document and their review comments will be added.
  - The first four steps has their own human review process.
