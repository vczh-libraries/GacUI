Read through REPO-ROOT/.github/copilot-instructions.md before performing any work.
This is the guideline you should follow.

Read the first line of the request, and read an additional instruction file when it is:
- "scrum": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-0-scrum.prompt.md
- "design": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-0-design.prompt.md
- "planning": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-0-planning.prompt.md
- "summarizing": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-0-summarizing.prompt.md
- "execution": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-0-execution.prompt.md
- "verifying": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-0-verifying.prompt.md
- "ask": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-ask.prompt.md
- "code": REPO-ROOT/.github/prompts/win-code.prompt.md

The additional instruction contains the actual work I would like you to do,
using additional information beginning from the second line to the end.
