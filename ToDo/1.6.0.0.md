## Milestone

- UI Automation
  - An interface to create an object and store in a control.
  - When children list of a control is updated, the object will get notified.
  - When template or template name is updated, the object will get notified.
  - Association is lazy: if a control leaves the top level window, the connection is released. Only when the object is required (e.g. read children from parent), it is connected.
  - An Windows implementation will convert the tree to UI Automation COM interfaces and expose through WM_GETOBJECT

## Instructions

You goal is to fill `Plan` and `Details` in this document.
GacUI is going to support Windows OS UI Automation technology, not the old MSA technology.
The first job is to fill the `Plan` section. It includes:
- First item: You need to get the link from MSDN (aka learn.microsoft.com) about this topic, write it down under the bullet item.
- Second item: There maybe multiple MSDN pages associated with it, write them down under the bullet item.
- Third item: Work out all UI Automation control types and their interfaces, organize them with their inheritance relationship (either actually or semantically inherited), list them in bullet using "- [ ]". Bullet items of a sub class must be under the base class. Each UI Automation must with its MSDN link.
- Fourth item: One actual `vl::presentation::controls::GuiX` class maps to multiple `ThemeName`, you are able to connect class to theme names based on their template class types. List all `ThemeName` enum item with "- [ ]" in their inheritance relationship, work out their mapping UI Automation control interface
- Other items: These controls are super complex, you must provide deeply details for them.

Now you got check lists of topics to research. Follow these instructions until you checks every item:
- Pick the first incomplete item in `Plan`, change from "- [ ]" to "- [+]" meaning you are working on it. You must immediately save the file to disk.
  - If the first incomplete item is "- [ ]", you are on a fresh start with this item. You can start a sub agent to work on it.
  - If the first incomplete item is "- [+]", it means you stopped at the middle, find out the corresponding title under `Details` and continue.
- Add it as a "###" title under `Details` section.
- Find out enough information and fill the title. The criteria of successful is that, one can follow the idea under this title, with helps from related mentioned MSDN links, and finish the coding work. You must immediatelly save the file to disk.
- Mark the item in `Plan` from "- [+]" to "- [*]" meaning you have finished this item.

At the moment, you don't need to mention in details about how to implement an UI Automation control interface using the GacUI control class. The more important work is to help one understand what a certain UI Automation control interface expectes the implementation to do. For examples, how many properties/events/actions can this UI Automation control interface offer, which in them are must have (aka not optional). You don't need to repeat in a child interface what is already in the parent interface.

## Plan

- [ ] How WM_GETOBJECT works
- [ ] How does UI Automation properties, events and actions work?
- [ ] UI Automation supported interfaces for controls
- [ ] Inheritance between `vl::presentation::templates::theme::ThemeName` and matching UI Automation control
- [ ] Details about container control with items (combo, list, tab, etc) and how do they handle items that are not visible (aka being scrolled out and cannot see it directly), and more.
- [ ] Details about list view's detail view, it works like a grid control unlike all other views are actually a list. How can UI Automation provide or each put control in a grid cell, and more.
- [ ] Details about plain text and rich text controls, how UI Automation support rich text viewing and editing, and more.
