# 1.6.0.0

# TODO

## Milestone

- UI Automation
  - An interface to create an object and store in a control.
  - When children list of a control is updated, the object will get notified.
  - When template or template name is updated, the object will get notified.
  - Association is lazy: if a control leaves the top level window, the connection is released. Only when the object is required (e.g. read children from parent), it is connected.
  - An Windows implementation will convert the tree to UI Automation COM interfaces and expose through WM_GETOBJECT
