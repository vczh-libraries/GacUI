# 1.2.13.0

## Milestone

- Prompt
  - It seems making a too detailed and specific task will make copilot care less.
  - Try to make copilot find side effect proactively.
  - Try to make copilot able to find a detailed enough solution from some simple query, but not too detailed which is what `:plan` should do.
    - Add a `:design` phase before `:plan`.
- GacUI
  - `<RawRendering/>` element.
    - Consider about accessing it in remote protocol renderer (both C++ and HTML), in core `ref.Name` is enough.
- `GuiRemoteController`
  - Reconnecting
    - Test sending disconnect or other events when `Submit()` is pending on the event.
    - Support failure injection in unit test, making `UnitTestRemoteProtocol::Submit()` returns `true` to its `disconnected` parameter.
- Unit Test Snapshot Viewer
  - Show dom nodes in a tree view in the right side of the rendering tab optionally.
  - Select dom node and jump to other tabs with highlight.
- All control unit test (using DarkSkin)
  - Tooltip.
  - Dialogs.
  - A mechanism to replace `vl::filesystem` implementation.
  - Add window resizing constraint messages.
    - Fix `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`.
    - Resizing should also send message so the UI could update layout and repaint.
  - Check all control key operation, ensure accessibility.
    - Cannot scroll `GuiScrollView`, key operations needed and also need to be disabled for `GuiListControl` because it has already defined item selection keys.
    - `Gui(Bindable)TextList` cannot check or uncheck items by key (enter and space).
    - `GuiVirtualListView` cannot operate column headers by key.
    - Active menus without `Alt` assighed (`TAB` and arrow keys?).
    - `GuiDateComboBox` does not receive focus property, so that when open year/month combo by `ALT` or mouse, list item cannot be selected only by key.
      - Add `Alt` and fix `Mouse` test cases after this is fixed.
