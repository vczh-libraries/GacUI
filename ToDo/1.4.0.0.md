## Milestone

- `<RawElement/>` element.
  - In remote protodol, a `Raw` element is used to pass some raw data (binary or text) to the renderer.
  - UnitTest
  - Direct2D
  - GDI
  - GacJS
- `DocumentElement` element.
  - Allow renderer and core in different unicode encoding.
- Add a metadata run to document model.
  - It has a text field for storing metadata in any application defined format.
  - It has a ordinary run for storing rendered document.
  - Metadata runs can be nested and is serializable.
- A demo of markdown editor in both editable source and editable preview mode.
  - Use SyncObj and work with https://github.com/github/copilot-sdk using nodejs
  - Ordinary testing and MVVM testing and UI testing
- SyncObj architecture that streams ViewModel object changes.
  - See README.md in Workflow repo (**Workflow Interface Based RPC**).
  - Workflow compiler will output metadata so that other language can do codegen.
  - Network protocols are not included as default implementation
  - Add channel name to remote protocol
    - A GacUI application could start remote protocol messaging even when it does not run with remote protocol.
    - When it runs with remote protocol, the remote protocol for GacUI deliver messages with a predefined channel name.
    - All SyncObj client has a dynamically allocated channel name by the central server implementation.
- New tutorials
  - A GacUI SyncDom process connecting to a server process for streaming graphics.
    - GDI+ implements in C#.
    - GDI/D2D implements in C++.
  - A GacUI D2D process connecting to a server process for streaming ViewModel
    - ViewModel implements in C++ and C#
- Rewrite `GacBuild.ps1` and `GacClear.ps1` in C++, but still keep them just doing redirection for backward compatibility.
- Get rid of `Deploy.bat` in `GacGen.ps1` and `GacGen.exe`.
- Document
  - SyncObj.
  - Fix `/doc/current/home.html`
    - Introduction to hosted / remote
  - Fix `/doc/current/gacui/home.html`
    - Introduction to hosted / remote
