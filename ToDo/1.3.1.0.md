## Known Issues

- UnitTestSnapshotViewer
  - It becomes slow when loading a large test case like `Test\Resources\UnitTestSnapshots\Controls\Ribbon\GuiRibbonButtons\Dropdowns.json`.
  - `UnitTestSnapshotFileNode::EnsureLoaded`, `JsonParse` takes too much time.
- `indexed(FromArray(xs))` crashes, because the enumerable created by `FromArray` is released before for-loop calling `begin`.
  - `indexed` takes a const reference might be the cause.
  - Consider making a version for right-value reference.
- GacUI_Controls/GlobalHotKey tutorial: pressing hot key doesn't work.
- GacUI_Controls/ProgressAndAsync tutorial: doesn't scroll to the top after downloading.
- Before resizing the window, in CppTest when alt into the first ribbin group, it unexpectedly stops instead of going into a deeper level.

## Copilot

- `kb-design.prompt.md`:
  - Clarify what should or should not be included in API Explanation or Design Insight.
- Generate `settings.json` and `tasks.json`. Currently supports only one unit test project. In `copilotCopyPrompt.ps1`.
- Keep prompts imperative, less declarative and no reactive (event handling).
- Besides learning in 0-scrum, also learn mybpreference in `kb-learning.prompt.md`, using all backed up files in `.github\Learnings`, and at the end delete all of them.
  - Create learning document for C++, Vlpp, CurrentProject, CurrentProjectTesting
  - The first 2 topics will be in KnowledgeBase
  - The rest will be in the repo, referenced by KnowledgeBase.vcxitems
  - `kb-learning.prompt.md` will remove everything that is strongly tighted to the current scrum
- `6-refactor.prompt.md`, apply persisted learnings to the code of the current task.
  - Or embed it in 2/3/4/5, and can be triggered by compile/test error.

## Milestone

- All control unit test (using DarkSkin)
  - `<RawRendering/>` element.
    - In remote protodol, a `Raw` element is used to pass some raw data (binary or text) to the renderer.
  - Implement `IGuiGraphicsParagraph`.
    - `GuiDocumentViewer`
    - `GuiDocumentLabel`
      - `<DocumentTextBox/>`
  - Ribbon
    - IconLabel with text box
  - Color Dialog
  - Font Dialog
  - File Dialog
- Document
  - Unit test framework.
  - Unit test framework in Vlpp.
  - Remote Protocol.
  - Starting GacUI Core with `SetupRemoteNativeController`.
  - Starting GacUI Rendering with `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`.

## UnitTest Sample in Release

- Sample unit test project included in release.
  - Or a standalone demo project contains everything: MVVM, unit test, remoting, hosted, etc.
  - Reflection enabled
    - Application and `LoadMainWindow` script in separated XML resource files.
    - Application and `LoadMainWindow` script in separated compiled resource files.
  - Reflection disabled
    - Application in compiled C++ files.
    - There is no `LoadMainWindow` in this case.
- Copy control unit tests, snapshots and snapshot viewer to `Release` repo.
  - Build and run test.
    - Explain this in decicated `README.md` and mention it in the root one.
  - Verify vcxproj contains all files.
