# 1.3.1.0

## Fixed Bugs:

- `GuiOpenFileDialog`/`GuiSaveFileDialog` does not apply default file extension to the file name before checking availability.
- GacUI Unit Test Framework stores logged UI frames in separated files to speed up `UnitTestSnapshotViewer` reaction.
- Global hot key not activated on a few keys

## Finished

- Remote Protocol unit test for text boxes
- Upgraded FindObjectByName to accept name chain

# TODO

## Known Issues

- `indexed(FromArray(xs))` crashes, because the enumerable created by `FromArray` is released before for-loop calling `begin`.
  - `indexed` takes a const reference might be the cause.
  - Consider making a version for right-value reference.
  - C++23 seems to extend the lifetime of the iterator object so that this will not crash. Confirm it.
- Before resizing the window, in CppTest when alt into the first ribbin group, it unexpectedly stops instead of going into a deeper level.

## Milestone

- A helper to attach/execute/detach event for one time aubscription, and update UnitTestSnapshotViewer to use it.
- All control unit test (using DarkSkin)
  - `<RawElement/>` element.
    - In remote protodol, a `Raw` element is used to pass some raw data (binary or text) to the renderer.
  - Check if any text box feature is not tested (e.g. PasswordChar)
  - Test GuiFileDialog filter item that has multiple extensions at the same time, exactly like Win32 API.
- Document
  - Unit test framework.
  - Unit test framework in Vlpp.
  - Remote Protocol.
  - Starting GacUI Core with `SetupRemoteNativeController`.
  - Starting GacUI Rendering with `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`.
  - VlppParser2 syntax.
- Ubuntu
  - Ensure `vgo vbuild` passes.

## Copilot

- `kb-design.prompt.md`:
  - Clarify what should or should not be included in API Explanation or Design Insight.
- Generate `settings.json` and `tasks.json`. Currently supports only one unit test project. In `copilotCopyPrompt.ps1`.
- Besides learning in 0-scrum, also learn mybpreference in `kb-learning.prompt.md`, using all backed up files in `.github\Learnings`, and at the end delete all of them.
  - Create learning document for C++, Vlpp, CurrentProject, CurrentProjectTesting
  - The first 2 topics will be in KnowledgeBase
  - The rest will be in the repo, referenced by KnowledgeBase.vcxitems
  - `kb-learning.prompt.md` will remove everything that is strongly tighted to the current scrum
- `6-refactor.prompt.md`, apply persisted learnings to the code of the current task.
  - Or embed it in 2/3/4/5, and can be triggered by compile/test error.
- Add more reformatting instruction in execution.prompt
  - Declare my header and cpp coding convention
  - Share compiling and testing between execution/verification/formatting/refactoring
