# 1.3.1.0

## Fixed Bugs:

- `GuiOpenFileDialog`/`GuiSaveFileDialog` does not apply default file extension to the file name before checking availability.
- GacUI Unit Test Framework stores logged UI frames in separated files to speed up `UnitTestSnapshotViewer` reaction.
- Global hot key not activated on a few keys

## Finished

- Remote Protocol unit test for text boxes
- Upgraded FindObjectByName to accept name chain

# TODO

## Milestone

- Implement `DocumentElement` in all already implemented remote renderers.
  - `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`

## Copilot

- `copilot-instructions.md`
  - Parsing XML and JSON.
  - Instructions for running CLI or GacUI projects. Need to update `# AFFECTED PROJECTS` instructions in `prompts\*.prompt.md`.
- `kb-design.prompt.md`:
  - Clarify what should or should not be included in API Explanation or Design Insight.
- `kb-learning.prompt.md`:
  - Write learnings to these files, including not only best practices but my preference:
    - `KnowledgeBase/Learning.md`: Learning that across projects, including C++, library using.
    - `Learning/Learning_Coding.md`: Learning that applies to this project's source.
    - `Learning/Learning_Testing.md`: Learning that applies to this project's test.
  - Put things to `Learning` instead of `KnowledgeBase` when this is some specific knowledge about the project itself.
  - Find the earliest log in `Learning`, focus on all updates and changes found from `scrum learning`, delete that folder.
  - Log whatever found. If any finding repeats, increase the counter.
  - The title must be short and include key idea, listed with the counter in the first section, sorted by counters.
  - Learning triggered by verb `refine`.
- Besides learning in 0-scrum, also learn my preference in `kb-learning.prompt.md`, using all backed up files in `.github\Learnings`, and at the end delete all of them.
  - Write into extra instruction files referenced by KnowledgeBase.vcxitems
    - Universal rules of tools and API usage
    - My preference
    - Extra knowledges and experiences of the current project.
  - `kb-learning.prompt.md` will remove everything that is strongly tighted to the current scrum.
- AI review/refactor based on copilot cli sdk so that multiple models can offer different ideas until they agree with each other.
  - In `AGENTS.md` save the latest message before converting to `TaskLogs/Copilot_Latest.md` untracked.
  - Ask in review prompt each model should save its opinion to `TaskLogs/Copilot_Review_Index_ModelName.md`.
    - Model names will be hardcoded in the prompt (and later will be automatically generated)
      - `Index` can be inferred by checking if all files from the previous round present.
      - Using model `GPT 5.2`, `Opus 4.6`, `Grok`, `Gemini 3 Pro`.
      - Using model name in file name: `GPT`, `Opus`, `Grok`, `Gemini`.
    - Read all `Index-1` version to collect information from the previous round.
    - If previous round exists, the document not only need to contain summarized idea, but also reply to each model's result.
    - If nothing to reply, say `AGREE` to the model.
    - After every reply is `AGREE`, another pass to summarize from all summarized ideas to `Copilot_Review.md`.
    - Apply `Copilot_Review.md` to change the document as it is my comment, delete all `Copilot_Review*.md`.
  - Each round of review should consider result from learning.
  - When prompt behaves good, use the sdk to automate.
  - Review triggered by verb `review scrum/design/plan/execution`.
