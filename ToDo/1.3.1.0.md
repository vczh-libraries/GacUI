# 1.3.1.0

## Fixed Bugs:

- `GuiOpenFileDialog`/`GuiSaveFileDialog` does not apply default file extension to the file name before checking availability.
- GacUI Unit Test Framework stores logged UI frames in separated files to speed up `UnitTestSnapshotViewer` reaction.
- Global hot key not activated on a few keys

## Finished

- Remote Protocol unit test for text boxes
- Upgraded FindObjectByName to accept name chain

# TODO

## Milestone

- Implement `DocumentElement` in all already implemented remote renderers.
  - `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`

## Copilot

- `copilot-instructions.md`
  - Parsing XML and JSON.
  - Instructions for running CLI or GacUI projects. Need to update `# AFFECTED PROJECTS` instructions in `prompts\*.prompt.md`.
- `kb-design.prompt.md`:
  - Clarify what should or should not be included in API Explanation or Design Insight.
