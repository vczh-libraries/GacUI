# 1.3.2.0

# TODO

## Milestone

- Implement `RawElement` in all already implemented remote renderers.
  - In remote protodol, a `Raw` element is used to pass some raw data (binary or text) to the renderer.
  - `UnitTestRemoteProtocol_Rendering<TProtocol>`
  - `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`
  - GacJS
- Implement `DocumentElement` in all already implemented remote renderers.
  - `GuiRemoteRendererSingle`
  - GacJS
  - Allow renderer and core in different unicode encoding.
- Binary Remote protocol
  - Investigate about generating data structure in flat memory layout, so that no effort needed for binary serialization
  - Binary version of `GuiRemoteProtocolFromJsonChannel` and `GuiRemoteJsonChannelFromProtocol`
  - Use it in named pipe demo
- `GuiRemoteController`
  - (optional) `Start` -> `StartWithUIThread` and `StartWithUIAndChannelThread`.
    - Move all UI and channel thread resources to two structs for easy refactoring.
    - The `StartWithUIThread` is useful when channel communication does not require to be done in a single thread, everything will be called from the UI thread and the receiver could be called from any non-UI thread.
- `GacUI_Remoting_Tests\*`
  - Add `/Simple` to run current test UI and `/Full` to run `FullControlTest`. One of them must be specified otherwise crash.
- `GacUI_Compiler_DependendTests\*`
  - Add `/D2D` and `/GDI` and make `/D2D` default.
- Remote Protocol samples in `Release` repo
- Unit Test
  - Test list control item providers and node providers.
  - Test `DocumentModel` editing functions.
