- Extensible CLI argument parser acception different OS convention, serialization and module dependencies.
  - Structured error report.
  - Extensible error message localization relying on GacUI XML Resource localization feature.
  - Pre-made main function per OS, defining arguments for different renderers for the current OS, including remoting server with predefine protocols.
- More optimistic SyncDom strategy to reduce messages.
- Windows
  - Ensure `INativeWindow::(Before|After)Closing()` is not called on non-main-window between the main window is closed and the application exits.
- GacUI
  - Implement colorizer on `GuiDocumentViewer`.
  - Enlarging window slower than shrinking.
  - https://github.com/vczh-libraries/Vlpp/issues/9

  - Is it able to pass text diff? Current `IGuiGraphidsParagraph` recreates so some implementation must be changed in the `GuiDocumentElement`.

    - Try search `.shift` and `->shift` to locate all places to modify

## UnitTest Sample in Release

- Sample unit test project included in release.
  - Or a standalone demo project contains everything: MVVM, unit test, remoting, hosted, etc.
  - Reflection enabled
    - Application and `LoadMainWindow` script in separated XML resource files.
    - Application and `LoadMainWindow` script in separated compiled resource files.
  - Reflection disabled
    - Application in compiled C++ files.
    - There is no `LoadMainWindow` in this case.
- Copy control unit tests, snapshots and snapshot viewer to `Release` repo.
  - Build and run test.
    - Explain this in decicated `README.md` and mention it in the root one.
